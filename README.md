This repository contains the data and code needed to reproduce the results of the paper "Estimating Confidence Intervals for Climate Econometrics Research" (in submission)

To re-generate the paper results and figures, run each script in `analysis_scripts/`. Results will be printed to the console and figurs will be generated in the `figures/` directory.

These scripts use reduced versions of each Bayesian model, as the original models are large and not included in this repository. They can be re-generated by running each script in the `sampling_scripts/` repository. Note that these scripts are long running as Bayesian sampling must complete.
